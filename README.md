## Overview

This is an application for finding information about movies and TV Shows. It is a sort of upgrade on one I made sometime ago - [check out Movio V1 here](https://github.com/ikennaezef/movio-website/) . It enables you to save/bookmark any movie of your choice which can be retrieved anytime even after the browser is closed. The app does not use any database i.e all the info is stored on the user's browser. It uses the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)
